# Rotten Tomatoes

#### As an avid movie watcher, I often find myself looking up a movie to see what reviews it has before I watch it. However I often times wonder whether the critical review of a movie is a good indicator of whether I will actually enjoy the movie or not. In order to test this, I decided to look at movie reveiws from Rotten Tomatoes. If 60% or more of critics gave a movie a positive rating, the movie is considered to be 'fresh'. However if less than 60% gave the movie positive ratings, then the movie is considered to be 'rotten'. Rotten Tomatoes also has audience scores. In order to test my question, I will scrape over 2000 movies from Rotten Tomatoes and see if the average audience score of 'fresh' movies and 'rotten' movies are statistically different.
