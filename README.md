# Rotten Tomatoes


## Background

>As an avid movie watcher, I often find myself looking up a movie to see what reviews it has before I watch it. However I often times wonder whether the critical review of a movie is a good indicator of whether I, or most people will actually enjoy the movie or not. Movie critics have a reputation for being snobbish, and I was curious as to whether this is true. In order to test this, I decided to look at movie reveiws from Rotten Tomatoes. Rotten Tomatoes is a website in which movies are listed with a review score that professional critics have given it, as well as an audience score.

## Hypothesis

> I hypothesize that the mean critic score for movies on Rotten Tomatoes is not within 5 points of of the audience score. In other words, the score that an audience gives a movie will on average be more than 5 points different from the critical review score.
